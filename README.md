<h3> Vector drawables overview </h3>

Android Studio can also convert SVG/PSD files to the vector drawable format<br>
The major advantage of using a vector drawable is image scalability. It can be scaled without loss of display quality, which means the same file is resized for different screen densities without loss of image quality. This results in smaller APK files and less developer maintenance


```diff
+  Right click on app folder-> New Vector Asset.
+  Select second option in radio button to create vector from local file as shown in below image.
```
